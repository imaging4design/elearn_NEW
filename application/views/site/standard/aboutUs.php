				<div class="multiseparator vc_custom"></div>

				<p><strong>eLearnEconomics</strong> is a comprehensive online economics learning resource.</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>eLearnEconomics is for both students AND teachers.</strong> Students study the concepts of each topic with the key notes, then review those concepts with the audio/video and flash card sections and finally test themselves in the written answer and multi-choice sections. The multi-choice section records student scores enabling them to track their progress and build their confidence leading into exams. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<strong>Teachers have the ability to monitor students progess within the teachers' administration section.</strong> Students can be arranged into class groups and full reports generated to quickly identify problem areas. These high quality PDF reports can also be presented at parent/teacher evenings.
				</p>
